Here's a curated list of books, papers, and articles I've read over the years that I recommend for anyone interested in Machine Learning and related AI topics. I often find myself returning to this collection to revisit and deepen my understanding of key concepts and ideas. While it's a handy resource for my own reference, I thought it might also be helpful to share it with others who share a passion for AI.
